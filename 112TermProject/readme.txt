The project is Pygame Super Smash Brothers with Artificial Intelligence. I have two different modes: singleplayer and multiplayer. For singleplayer, the user commands are (leftarrow) to move left, (rightarrow) to move right, ((uparrow) to adjust the angle upwards and (downarrow) to adjust the angle downwards for Pit), (a) to range attack, (s) to melee attack, and (space) to jump. For multiplayer, the user commands for P1 are the same but for P2, the user commands are (j) to move left, (l) to move right, ((i) to adjust the angle upwards and (k) to adjust the angle downwards for Pit), (n) to range attack, (m) to melee attack, and (return) to jump. For the singleplayer mode, this program will simulate a game of Super Smash Bros against an AI. The player will be able to choose from two different characters and also select the character to go against. Each different character has a unique AI best suited for its fighting strategy, fighting moves, and stats. Lucario makes use of its wellrounded ness by having a balanced strategy. Bowser makes use of its powerful melee attack by attacking more rather than defending. Pikachu makes use of its speed and stun power by having a different set of moves when the opponent is stunned. Pit makes use of its projectile motion by calculating if a move is valid to make based on avoiding obstacle collisions and hitting the player and adjusts its position if move is not valid.

To run the program, run supersmash.py. In addition, you should have the Character.py class and its subclasses, including lucario.py, Bowser.py, Pikachu.py, and Pit.py in the same folder as supersmash.py. You should also have Surfaces.py in the same folder as supersmash.py. You should also have all the images in the images folder.

To have the needed libaries for the game, you must have pygame in python 3.6. To install pygame, install pygame onto terminal. In addition, on pyzo, you must edit your shell configurations to use python 3.6.

There are no shortcut commands.
